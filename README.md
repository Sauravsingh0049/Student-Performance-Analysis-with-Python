- Utilized **Power Query** to extract and transform the data, then transferred the data to **Power Pivot** for further analysis.
- **Power Pivot** is used to store the data for further exploration in the future, if the number of rows increases into the millions.
- Implemented **IF** and **COUNTA** functions to prepare reports that interpret sales, Status, channel, category, size, shipped state, age and gender.
